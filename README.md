Metadata Tagging and Policy Expression: Demonstrate the use of blockchain for security metadata and tagging to manage access, provide auditing and provenance information.

By doing the above the following is being demonstrated:
1. The storage of metadata (ownership, access rights, security credentials) for medical records
2. Validation is happening via the metadata at the time of access - grants
3. For audit purpose there is clear trail of when all the particular report was accessed and who all asked for it
4. For provenance, the origination of the report (lab and prescribing physician is tagged to the metadata)
